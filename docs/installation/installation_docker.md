## Installing loklak on AWS with Docker

1. Sign in to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)

2. In the top-right corner, choose a area you want to set up the instance, e.g.: Asia Pacific (Singapore).

3. In the console panel, choose EC2. In EC2 Control Panel, choose key pairs, under Network & Security, and create a new key pair. It will automatically download the private key, and you should do ```chmod 400 YOUR_KEY_NAME``` to prevent other user to access your private key. After that, go back to your dashboard, and click Launch Instance.

4. In Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image, we choose ```Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type```.

5. In Step 2: Choose an Instance Type, we choose ```t2.micro```(<strong>Warning:</strong> ```t2.micro``` is not suitable for running loklak for a long period, and AWS may shut down your instance(block your Internet access on specific port) at any time. ```t2.micro``` instance users are only allow to use <strong>10%</strong> of a single CPU core on average. In our case, loklak_server uses 30 - 40% on average. Reference: [Burstable Instance](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#burst)  Case study: [Real case running loklak](http://geekinguniverse.com/2016/01/14/dont-use-aws-for-your-web-application/))

6. Then we click ```Configure Instance Details```, do not create a instance yet.

7. Under ```Auto-assign Public IP```, we choose ```Enable```

8. Then we click ```Next: Add Storage```

9. We modify the storage to ```30GiB``` instead of default ```8Gib```

10. Click ```Next``` twice to go to ```Step 6: Configure Security Group```. Under this, we choose ```All TCP``` for type and ```Anywhere``` for source.

11. We are ready to launch, click ```Review and Launch```, if everything is correct, click ```Launch```. It will ask you to choose a key pair, choose the one we just created.

12. We go back to EC2 control panel again. Click on instances on the left hand side. Then choose the instance you just created, and click connect button on top. It will you connect to your EC2 by giving you a example like:
	```
	ssh -i "loklak.pem" ubuntu@ec2-54-169-103-75.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
	```

13. Once connected, we have to set up docker and add a 4G swapfile to prevent lack of memory:
	```
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get -y upgrade
	sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
	sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
	sudo mkswap /swapfile
	sudo swapon /swapfile
	sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-`uname -r`
	sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609D
	echo "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-trusty main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install docker-engine
	```

14. Once docker is installed, we start our loklak-server by entering:
	```
	sudo docker pull mariobehling/loklak
	sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 mariobehling/loklak:latest
	```

15. Check if Loklak is running on your server, by going to your public DNS, e.g.: ```ec2-54-169-103-75.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com```.

## Installing loklak on Google Cloud with Docker


1. Go to [Google Cloud Free Trial](https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/) and sign up. You will get 300 dollars credit for 3 months.


2. Go to the console page: [Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home)


3. If you donâ€™t have any projects, a page that would guide you on how to start a project will pop up. Give your project a name.


4. In the search bar above on console page, enter 'Compute Engine' and click on ```Compute Engine```. 


5. If you have not activated billing for compute engine, click enable billing and choose your account to activate your Compute Engine. Your Google Compute Engine should be activated within a few minutes.


6. Click ```Create instance``` to create an instance. In machine type, choose ```small(1 shared vCPU)```.
	Choose whatever zone you like.
 
	In Boot Disk, choose ```Ubuntu 14.04```, and the disk size should be larger than 40GB.
	On the bottom of the page, click ```Management, disk, networking, access & security options``` to show more options. Inside of this, click into the tab ```Networking``` and choose ```New static IP``` instead of ```Ephemeral```. Enter a name for your IP. Google will assign a IP for you.
	Check the two boxes ```Allow HTTP traffic``` and ```Allow HTTPS traffic```. Finally, click ```Create``` to create an instance. Wait a few minutes for the creation to complete.


7. Once the creation has finished, click ssh below to establish web ssh connections.

8. In the Web Console, enter:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install docker.io
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo docker build https://github.com/loklak/loklak_server.git
```

Once finished, the last line will provide the image ID, like ```Successfully built 4e11208a7b34```. Copy or remember this id, we will need this id to tag the image.
Tag your image by entering ```sudo docker tag YOUR_IMAGE_ID loklak```. In my case, we enter ```sudo docker tag 4e11208a7b34 loklak```
Run our server by entering:
```
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 loklak
```
Enter your assigned IP address into your browser to check if it is working.
