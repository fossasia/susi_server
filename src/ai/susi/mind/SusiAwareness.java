/**
 * Awareness is a specific sequence of cognitions.
 * Susi is conscious about a part of that sequence which is caused by an awareness limit.
 * The limit is currently artificial (like: hardcoded) but a heuristic which creates such
 * a limit based on a signal that creates a kind of self-reference would actually create
 * a perception of time which is here defined as the lengh of the resulting cognition sequence.
 * 
 * This class therefore also contains a definition of time which means: the perception of
 * time for Susi minds.
 * 
 * The awareness memory is implemented as Deque list where the first entry
 * always has the latest cognition and the last cognition is the termination element.

 * TODO: the termination element should represent some kind of self-reference cognition.
 * Then awareness would express all cognitions until the time where a Susi mind remembers itself.
 * That could be a simple model of consciousness.
