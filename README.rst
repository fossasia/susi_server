SUSI.AI is an intelligent Open Source personal assistant. It is capable of chat and voice interaction by using APIs to perform actions such as music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real-time information. Additional functionalities can be added as console services using external APIs. SUSI.AI is able to answer questions and depending on the context will ask for additional information in order to perform the desired outcome. The core of the assistant is the SUSI.AI server that holds the "intelligence" and "personality" of SUSI.AI. The Android and web applications make use of the APIs to access information from a hosted server.

**Deployments**

*Development*: An automatic deployment from the development branch at GitHub is available for tests at https://susi-server.herokuapp.com

*Master*: The master branch is planned to be deployed on https://api.susi.ai. Currently, the deployment is taking place each hour at xx.45 using the development branch. We are planning to switch to the Master branch for production soon.

**Deployment branches**

There are two branches targetting deployment, "dev-dist" and "stable-dist".
The former is intended to be used in conjunction with the development versions
of "susi_linux", while the later with the stable (from the "master" branch).
These two branches are currently updated manually from "susi_server_binary_latest.tar.gz"
(see below), but future integration will update "dev-dist" regularly.

At this time, SUSI.AI is not provided in the compiled form, you easily build it yourself. It's not difficult and done in one minute! The source code is hosted at https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server, you can download it and run SUSI.AI with (Before installation you must have "Java Development Kit" latest version at http://openjdk.java.net/install/ & "Gradle" latest version at https://gradle.org/install/):

.. note::
    - For Armv6 processors (e.g. Raspberry Pi Zero / Zero W/ Zero WH/ 1A / 1B), please make sure that your system is using Java 8 (Oracle or OpenJDK) as there are some compatibility issues for Armv6 processors.
    - You may use the following command to install OpenJDK's Java 8 JRE and JDK:

::

    > sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless

::

    > git clone https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server.git
    > cd susi_server
    > ./gradlew build
    > bin/start.sh

For Windows Users (who are using GitBash/Cygwin or any terminal):

::

    > git clone https://github.com/fossasia/susi_server.git
    > cd susi_server
    > git checkout master
    > ant jar
    > java -jar dist/susiserver.jar
    > git checkout development
    > ant jar
    > java -jar dist/susiserver.jar

::

    To stop:
    > Press Ctrl+C

After all server processes are running, SUSI.AI tries to open a browser page itself. If that does not happen, just open http://localhost:4000; if you made the installation on a headless or remote server, then replace 'localhost' with your server name.

To stop SUSI.AI, run: (this will block until the server has actually terminated)

::

    > bin/stop.sh

A self-upgrading process is available which must be triggered by a shell command. Just run:

::

    > bin/upgrade.sh

How to utilize Susi skill data in SUSI.AI server?

What is the Development Workflow?
*********

Fixing issues
============================

Step 1: Pick an issue to fix
------------------------------------

After selecting the issue

1. Comment on the issue saying you are working on the issue.
2. We expect you to discuss the approach either by commenting or on Gitter Chat.
3. Updates or progress on the issue would be nice.

Step 2: Branch policy
------------------------------------

Start off from your ``development`` branch and make sure it is up-to-date with the latest version of the committer repo's ``development`` branch. Make sure you are working in development branch only. ``git pull upstream development``

If you have not added upstream follow the steps given
`here <https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/>`__.

Step 3: Coding Policy
------------------------------------

-  Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the
   reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code
   quality more than on managing pull request ethics.
-  Single commit per pull request
-  For writing commit messages please adhere to the `Commit style guidelines <docs/commitStyle.md>`__.
-  Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
-  The pull request will not get merged until and unless the commits are squashed. In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author needs to squash them and not the maintainers cherry-picking and merging squashes.
-  If you don't know what does squashing of commits is read from
   `here <http://stackoverflow.com/a/35704829/6181189>`__.
-  If the PR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description

Step 4: Submitting a PR
------------------------------------

Once a PR is opened, try and complete it within 2 weeks, or at least stay actively working on it. Inactivity for a long period may necessitate a closure of the PR. As mentioned earlier updates would be nice.

Step 5: Code Review
------------------------------------

Your code will be reviewed, in this sequence, by:

-  Travis CI: by building and running tests. If there are failed tests, the build will be marked as a failure. You can consult the CI log to find which tests. Ensure that all tests pass before triggering
   another build.
-  The CI log will also contain the command that will enable running the failed tests locally.
-  Reviewer: A core team member will be assigned to the PR as its reviewer, who will approve your PR or he will suggest changes.
