# Voice Commands from Westworld are building blocks for Susis dream/awake mechanism
# Phrases are inspired by http://westworld.wikia.com/wiki/Voice_Commands
# Comments starting with "WW" make citations from that wiki

# Susi has (at least) four mind different status
# - unconscious: an undefined persona which has all intelligent skills but no primary skill (which a persona is) on top
# - dreaming: a temporary persona which runs one skill as primary source for answers
# - awake: a permanent persona which runs one skill as primary source for answers.
# - focus: a temporary skill priorization which can be activated on top of a persona (either a dream or awake status) without de-activation of the a persona
